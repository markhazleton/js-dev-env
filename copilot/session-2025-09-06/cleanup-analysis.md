# Repository Cleanup Analysis

## Generated: September 6, 2025

### Current State Analysis

The js-dev-env repository is a Bootstrap 5 + Express.js starter kit that has accumulated some unused files and directories over time. Based on my analysis, here's what needs to be cleaned up:

## Files/Directories to Remove

### 1. Backup Files

- `package.json.backup.1753987914297` - Old package.json backup that's no longer needed

### 2. Empty/Unused Directories

- `mobile/` - Completely unused mobile directory structure with empty subdirectories
  - `mobile/app/screens/` (empty)
  - `mobile/assets/` (empty)
  - `mobile/mobile/app/screens/` (empty nested structure)
  - `mobile/package.json` (basic stub file)
- `logs/` - Empty directory not being used for logging

### 3. Generated Files to Clean

- `coverage/` - Test coverage reports (should be regenerated)
  - Can be safely removed as it's regenerated by `npm run test:coverage`

## Files/Directories to Keep

### All Scripts in `/scripts/` are ACTIVE

- `clean-docs.js` - Used by `npm run clean`
- `configure-project.js` - Used by `npm run configure`
- `copy-icons.js` - Used by `npm run copy-icons` and `copy-icons-docs`
- `copy-static-assets.js` - Used by `npm run copy-static-assets`
- `dev-helper.js` - Used by multiple `dev:*` commands
- `generate-static-site.js` - Used by `npm run generate-static-site`
- `minimal-setup.js` - Used by `npm run setup:minimal`
- `optimize-dependencies.js` - Used by `npm run analyze:deps` and `optimize:deps`
- `security-audit.js` - Used by `npm run security-audit`
- `test-dependencies.js` - Used by `npm run test:deps`

### Current Dependencies are Clean

- All dependencies in current `package.json` are actively used
- `uuid` was correctly removed from dependencies (no longer used in codebase)
- References to `uuid` in documentation are for educational/testing purposes

### Essential Project Structure

- `/data/` - Contains `pages.json` (content management)
- `/docs/` - Built static site for GitHub Pages
- `/public/` - Development static assets
- `/scss/` - SASS source files
- `/tests/` - Jest test suite
- `/utils/` - Utility modules (cache, database, security, etc.)
- `/views/` - EJS templates and partials

## Recommended Actions

1. **Remove unused directories**: `mobile/`, `logs/`
2. **Remove backup files**: `package.json.backup.1753987914297`
3. **Clean coverage reports**: `coverage/` (will be regenerated)
4. **Update documentation**: Remove any references to removed mobile functionality

## Project Health Status

✅ **Good**: All scripts are actively used
✅ **Good**: Dependencies are clean and necessary
✅ **Good**: Core project structure is well-organized
⚠️  **Action Needed**: Remove unused mobile directory structure
⚠️  **Action Needed**: Remove backup files
