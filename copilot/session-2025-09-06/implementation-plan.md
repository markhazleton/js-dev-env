# Repository Cleanup Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Remove Unused Directories and Files

### Step 1: Remove Empty/Unused Mobile Directory

- Target: `mobile/` directory and all subdirectories
- Reason: Completely unused mobile app structure with empty directories

### Step 2: Remove Empty Logs Directory

- Target: `logs/` directory
- Reason: Empty directory not being used by the application

### Step 3: Remove Backup Files

- Target: `package.json.backup.1753987914297`
- Reason: Old backup file no longer needed

### Step 4: Clean Generated Coverage Reports

- Target: `coverage/` directory
- Reason: Generated files that should be regenerated fresh

## Phase 2: Verification

- Verify all scripts in `/scripts/` are still referenced in package.json
- Confirm all current dependencies are used
- Test build process after cleanup

## Execution Commands

1. Remove mobile directory
2. Remove logs directory  
3. Remove backup file
4. Remove coverage directory
5. Run npm run test:coverage to regenerate coverage
6. Run npm run build to verify build process works
